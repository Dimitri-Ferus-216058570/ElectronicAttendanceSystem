## Project Title 
Electronic Attendance System

## Domain
This project falls primarily under the Human Resource Management Domain(HRM). While this application can be used to track the attendance of students at school, it can be extended to be used in corporate enviroments to track the attendance and working hours of employees.  In the intended educational setting it may assist in monitoring school students behaviour regarding attendance of school and may be used as a tool to enhance academic performance and assist in managing institutional records.

## Problem Statement
The current manual attendance tracking system at  is inefficient and unreliable, leading to inaccuracies in attendance records, increased administrative workload, and potential negative impacts on student performance. There is a need for an automated, secure, and user-friendly electronic attendance system to enhance accuracy, reduce administrative burden, and provide real-time data access for stakeholders.

Objectives:
• Teacher Attendance Recording: Implement a system that teachers can  capture student attendance, minimizing manual intervention and errors.
• Enhance Data Accuracy: Ensure precise and tamper-proof attendance records to reflect true student participation.
• Reduce Administrative Workload: Streamline the attendance process to allow staff to focus on more critical educational tasks.
• Provide Real-Time Access: Enable immediate access to attendance data for teachers, administrators, students, and parents.
• Integrate with Existing Systems: Ensure compatibility with current school management software for seamless data flow.

## Individual Scope

### Infrastructure required:
IDE to code the program, where Intellij Idea is the prefered IDE and the free student edition will be used. A computer to conduct the coding will be needed and the needed coding knowledge in order to impliment the application.

### Integration:
The application should be able to seamlessly integrate with the existing school system in order to ensure data consistency and streamline operations.

### User Acceptance:
The success of the system will rely on the accpetance of teacher, students, administrative staff and the parents of the students. There may also be a need for training to be provided for the users of the system such as the teachers and administrative staff. 

### Operational and investment cost:
Cost such as licencing, software development and extention of the system to encompass hardware such as RFID readers and biometric scanners should be taken into consideration.  For operational costs, maintenance costs, updates and training for new users should be taken into consideration.
