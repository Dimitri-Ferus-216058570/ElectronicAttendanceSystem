## Justification for choosing Automated Kanban
The reason for choosing Automatic Kanban was because it supports sprint tracking with built in automation. Another reason is that it came highly recommended by a peer in the course, who is a practicing software engineer. Their project team uses it in their projects. It aligns well with Agile principles, and it also has a very flexible design allowing for adding unexpected work.  Making use of cards can help to visualise and understand what the teams is working towards. Using Kanban boards helps to display how tasks are moving through their different stages, which makes it easy to see what is being done and worked on at a certain point in time.

## Readme
I’ve added a “Testing” column in order to track the testing of features to ensure that testing becomes part of the project and isn’t left for the end of the project or before integration. It will also assist in making the team aware that testing the product or feature is not something that should be overlooked. I’ve also added a “Code Review” in order to ensure that peer review is done in the project. It is implemented in order to facilitate quality control and to encourage collaboration between team members. Doing peer reviews will help team members to learn from each other and to identify that another set of eyes will help in creating a better product and may also avoid bad habits that may have been learnt without the team member knowing. The column would also ensure that the errors are identified early and may assist in reducing work later on in the project.
