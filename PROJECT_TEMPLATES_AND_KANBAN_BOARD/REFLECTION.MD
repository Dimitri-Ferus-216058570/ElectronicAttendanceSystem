## Challenges 

Some of the challenges faced in choosing a template was the fact that I have never works on a software project in a software setting. Having to choose a template required reading up on the different types of templates available and then having to filter them in order to find the templates that conform to agile principles. This was also a difficulty in that not having completed a professional agile project, could make it difficult to understand and implement the inner workings of an agile project. It made it abundantly clear, the sheer magnitude of the project management philosophies and tools available. What however aided me was the fact that the Kanban board came highly recommended by searching through the information available online. What also helped me in choosing Kanban was the fact that one of my peers in the Post Grad course, who is a practising software engineer, recommended it since they were using it in their projects, this coupled with the flexible nature of Kanban boards swayed my opinion towards choosing this template for my project. Some of the lesson learnt was that there are many templates available for tracking and planning a project and that there are many ways to implement and manage the workflow of a project.

## Comparing other Tools

Trello 
Trello has many categories of templates such as Business Templates, Design Templates, Engineering, etc. For the software engineering templates it has a vast variety such as, Swift developer roadmap, Site reliability, etc. It seems to have a big variety of templates but what may deter some software engineers from using it is that it seems to also have a paid version that shows that you may not have access to certain functions of the site.

Jira
Jira is an application lifecycle management and agile project management tool created by Atlassian. Jira seems to have many different categories of templates, but the software engineering templates seem to align with the templates provided by GitHub. It also seems to champion sprint and may be a good alternative for developers that make use of agile development.

ClickUp
ClickUp has many templates but the site seems a bit daunting to navigate. While the other sites were easy to navigate and find what you were looking for the ClickUp site takes a bit more work to find the software engineering templates and in order to view these them you need to sign up in order to view or get further information.

In terms of how GitHub compares to the other available platforms, GitHub seems to concentrate more on software engineering or development. While other platforms attempt to provide a one stop site for all or rather most project management needs. While Jira is a platform that is very popular platform as it seems to be a prerequisite for many software engineering jobs. I however would prefer GitHub since I have experience working in it, GitHub easy to use and understand and payment does not seem to be a big driver behind GitHub's features.
