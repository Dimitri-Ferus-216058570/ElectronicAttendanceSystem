## Kanban Board

A Kanban board is a tool to visualise work, limit work-in-progress (WIP) and maximise efficiency in predominantly agile projects. Kanban board are a very flexible tool the can be created using a physical board in an office or created using software to facilitate remote collaboration. It makes use of columns, cards and continuous improvement to manage the workload of a project. It visualises work flows by making use of columns such as Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, Done, Test and Blocked in order to keep track of tasks. It helps to limit WIP and our project limits our tasks to 3 in progress in order to avoid bottlenecks. This ensures that if 3 tasks are in the workflow, they must be completed before new tasks can be added and it gives an early warning sign if too much work has been taken on by the project team. Kanban supports agile development because it supports iterative development, since Kanban boards are very flexible in where elements can be added according to the complexity and magnitude of the project and it is simple to set up a digital Kanban, in order to share it with other members of the project team for collaboration purposes.
