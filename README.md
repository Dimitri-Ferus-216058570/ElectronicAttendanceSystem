## Reasoning for Patterns

1.The Prototype Pattern was chosen for attendance marking due to the fact that these templates will be reused and cloning is more efficient than creating them from scratch. It will go a long way in improving performance.

2. The Abstract Factory Pattern was chosen fore Notifications because if other ways of communication needs to be added the patterns allows for dynamic choices between different types of notifications.
   
3. The Factory Method Pattern was choses for the Attendance marking function due to the fact that attendance can be marked manually or automatically, it will assist when new functions and behaviours need to be added such as facial recognition and biometrics.  Can add new functions without modifying existing code.
   
4.The Simple Factory Pattern was chosen for creating Users because there are many different types of users, but have more or less the same behaviour and attributes. This will make it easier to manage users and to assist with separation of concerns.

5.The Builder pattern was chosen for the Report function due to the fact that content may vary and to make object creation more flexible.

6. The Singleton pattern was chosen for a database connection to avoid multiple connections to eliminate inconsistency and to control access to resources.
