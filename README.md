# Electronic Attendance System

In education, accurately tracking student attendance is crucial for monotoring academic performance, ensuring students safety and maintaining institutional accountability. Traditional methods of marking attendance have become time consuming and an expensive exercise which may be prone to errors. The proposed system will be used to electronically mark attendance of students in order to eliminate errors, eliminate costs in regard to providing space for records, streamlining the attendance marking process, provide easily accessible reports and records related to attendance and promoting accountability among staff and students.  The system can provide a centralised point for retreiving data in regard to attendance, assist the education department in compiling statistics and providing the broader country in showing transparency over the attendance of school going students in South Africa.
