## Reflection 



Creating the diagrams took a high degree of effort. Making the diagrams more readable, but still keeping as much detail as possible is also very difficult. These drawings need to be understood by the development team and as much detail is needed. However all stakeholders should be considered, thus too much detail could confuse the stakeholders of the system. It could make them it hard for them to truly gain a vision of how the applications should an will function. Creating these diagrams are also very time consuming and could affect the project completion schedule and it may be regarded as a minimal task. The diagrams however are very important and can assist especially the development team gain a deeper understanding of the proposed system. Having complete documentation can assist in a deeper understanding of the project and can eliminate errors early in the project rather than later where it could be more costly. 



State diagrams give an important view of the different states in the application and help to visualise how the activity diagrams would function. Both can act as a initial blueprint for each other. Activity diagrams do a great job of identifying all actors in the system and what processes are completed by them. This could help differentiate between what user responsibilities are and what functions the system would be need to complete. State diagrams help to understand what would trigger a reaction from the system and in what state these triggers would leave th system. Overall these diagrams compliment each other and may assist all stakeholders in understanding the system. However the project team needs to keep in mind that they should be kept as simple as possible in order for all parties involved in the system to gain insight into the end product.
